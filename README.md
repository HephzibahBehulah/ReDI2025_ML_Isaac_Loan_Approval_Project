# ReDI2025_ML_Isaac_Loan_Approval_Project
### Task Description

**Objective**  
Develop a binary classification system to predict whether a loan application will be **Approved** or **Rejected** based on applicant and loan characteristics.

**Key Requirements**
- Perform data preprocessing: handle missing values and properly encode categorical variables.
- Address class imbalance (significantly more approved than rejected loans).
- Train and evaluate **six** classification models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - LightGBM
  - CatBoost
- Focus evaluation on **Precision, Recall, and F1-score** (especially for the minority “Rejected” class), alongside overall accuracy and confusion matrix analysis.
- Demonstrate realistic model behavior that mirrors real-world banking practices.

**Dataset**  
[Loan Approval Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/architsharma01/loan-approval-prediction-dataset) – a clean, real-world-style credit risk dataset commonly used for benchmarking classification performance.
